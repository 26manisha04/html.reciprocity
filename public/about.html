<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Manisha, a B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering student at Punjabi University, Patiala (2022–2026). I have a strong interest in technology, with hands-on experience in Embedded Systems (6 weeks industrial training at Novem Control, Mohali) and a growing skill set in Web Development and DSA.</p>

<p>I enjoy combining my technical knowledge with creativity — thanks to my background in graphic designing — which helps me build both functional and visually appealing projects. Currently, I’m enhancing my skills through a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy and strengthening my problem-solving abilities with DSA from Apna College.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I’m a curious learner who loves reading (rom-coms & knowledge books), cooking, and staying committed to a healthy lifestyle. I dream of traveling the world 🌍 and always aim to keep growing, both personally and professionally.</p>
